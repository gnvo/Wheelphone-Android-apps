# Wheelphone-Android-apps

My repository for applications for a robot that uses a smartphone as its brains and eyes ([Wheelphone](http://www.wheelphone.com/)). This repository is for showcase purpose only. I developed the initial version of these apps during an internship. Now the latest version of these apps resides in [GCtronic Wheelphone android apps](https://github.com/gctronic/wheelphone-applications/tree/master/android-applications).

A short description of each app:
* **Wheelphone_alarm:** An alarm app that makes the robot run away when the user wants to stop the alarm.
* **Wheelphone_faceme:** An app that uses face detection to make the robot face the user and keep its distance at all times.
* **Wheelphone_follow:** An app that makes use of the proximity sensors in the robot to follow (keep the distance) to an object in front of it.
* **Wheelphone_navigator:** An app that uses OpenCV and the camera to detect and follow blobs of color, while avoiding obstacles with the use of the proximity sensors.
* **Wheelphone_pet:** An app that makes the robot behave like a pet. It uses the camera, proximity sensors and a stochastic behavioral system
